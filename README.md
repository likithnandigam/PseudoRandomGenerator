# PseudoRandomGenerator
VLSI Design Layout of a Pseudo Random Noise Generator

A Pseudo Random Noise Generator, as the name says generates an arbitrary noise signal in the form of Binary 0's and 1's. The circuit that I have designed in this project is a 4-bit random noise generator. The layout consists of 60 transistors and 63 nodes. 

Instructions:
1) Download all the files in the repository
2) Create a directory to house these files
3) Use the 'example.tdb' file as the default technology reference
4) 'Generic_180nm.ext' and 'mosis_tsmc_180nm_18.model' are the reference files for setting up T-Spice and W-Edit
5) 'Design Project.tdb' is the layout of the circuit and 'Project Circuit.spc' is the corresponding spice file.

Software(s) needed: Tanner EDA Tools v16.03 and above

Note: Create a new spice file for observing the transient reponse of the circuit
